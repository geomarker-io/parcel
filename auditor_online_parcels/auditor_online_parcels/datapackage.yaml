    description: "\n## Hamilton County Auditor Online Data\n\nThe `hamilton_online_parcels`
      tabular data resource contains parcel characteristics scraped from [Hamilton
      County Auditor Online](https://wedge1.hcauditor.org/) and linked to the parcel
      identifers in the `cagis_parcels` data package.\nCharacteristics include the
      \"parcel id\", \"year built\", \"number of total rooms\", \"number of bedrooms\",
      \"number of full bathrooms\", \"number of half bathrooms\", and a \"market total
      value\" (named `online_total_market_value` to distinguish it from the market
      total value in `cagis_parcels`). \n\nIn general, `online_market_total_value`
      is based on values extracted from the Hamilton County Auditor's online website
      and is preferred over `market_total_value` derived from historical building
      records maintained by CAGIS in `cagis_parcels`."
