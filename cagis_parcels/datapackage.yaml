    description: "# parcel\n\n> Older versions of this repository contain an R package
      that relies on the usaddress and dedupe python libraries for address matching.
      Consider using the {[addr](https://github.com/cole-brokamp/addr)} R package
      instead for more precise and accurate matching to CAGIS parcel identifiers (and
      fewer dependencies).\n\nThis repository contains two tabular data resources:
      `cagis_parcels` and `hamilton_online_parcels`.\n\n## Parcel Identifiers and
      Corresponding Parcel Addresses\n\nA `parcel_id` refers to the Hamilton County
      Auditor’s “Parcel Number”, which is referred to as the “Property Number” within
      the CAGIS Open Data and uniquely identifies properties.\nIn rare cases, multple
      addresses can share the same parcel boundaries, but have unique `parcel_id`s
      and in these cases, their resulting centroid coordinates would also be identical.\n\nWithin
      the process of matching to a parcel, an individual address could be merged with
      differing types and resolutions of data:\n\n``` mermaid\n%%{init: { \"fontFamily\":
      \"arial\" } }%%\n\nflowchart LR\nclassDef id fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px;\nclassDef
      tool fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5 2;\nclassDef

      \\n (e.g., two family dwelling, \\n apartment with 20-39 units)\"):::data\n\nhc
      --> npm(not matched \\nto a parcel):::tool\n```\n\n### Condominiums\n\nBecause
      “second line” address components (e.g., “Unit 2B”) are not captured, a single
      address can refer to multiple parcels in the case of condos or otherwise shared
      building ownership.\nFor example, the address “323 Fifth St” has six distinct
      `parcel_id`s, each with different home values and land uses:\n\n| parcel_id
      \  | market_total_value | land_use                    |\n|:------------|-------------------:|:----------------------------|\n|
      14500010321 |             397500 | condominium unit            |\n| 14500010317
      |             123000 | condominium office building |\n| 14500010320 |             180000
      | condominium unit            |\n| 14500010319 |             255000 | condominium
      unit            |\n| 14500010322 |             388230 | condominium unit            |\n|
      14500010318 |             239500 | condominium unit            |\n\n### Large
      Apartment Complexes\n\nLarge apartment complexes often use multiple mailing
      addresses that are not the same as the parcel address(es). \n\n## CAGIS Parcels
      Data\n\nThe `cagis_parcels` tabular-data-resource contains parcel identifiers,
      parcel addresses, and parcel characteristics downloaded from the [Cincinnati
      Area Geographic Information System (CAGIS)](https://cagismaps.hamilton-co.org/cagisportal/mapdata/download)\n\nCreated
      with `R/_____.R`\n\nRead into R with:\n\n(Hyperlink to TDR metadata)\n\nAuditor
      parcel-level data were excluded if they (1) did not contain a parcel identifier,
      (2) did not contain a property address number/name, or (3) had a duplicated
      parcel identifier.\n\nParcels with the following land use categories are included
      in the data resource and others are excluded.\nThese were selected to reflect
      *residential* usages of parcels.\n\n| land_use                       |\n|:------------------------------:|\n|
      single family dwelling         |\n| condominium unit               |\n| two
      family dwelling            |\n| apartment, 4-19 units          |\n| landominium
      \                   |\n| three family dwelling          |\n| condo or pud garage
      \           |\n| other residential structure    |\n| metropolitan housing authority
      |\n| apartment, 40+ units           |\n| apartment, 20-39 units         |\n|
      manufactured home              |\n| office / apartment over        |\n| boataminium
      \                   |\n| other commercial housing       |\n| mobile home / trailer
      park     |\n| lihtc res                      |\n\nSome of the parcel characteristics
      do not make sense in certain contexts and should not be interpreted incorrectly;
      for example, the value of a parcel for a multi-family or multi-unit housing
      structure shouldn’t be compared to the value of a parcel for a single-family
      household for the purposes of assesing individual-level SES.\n\n## Hamilton
      County Auditor Online Data\n\nThe `hamilton_online_parcels` tabular data resource
      contains parcel characteristics scraped from [Hamilton County Auditor Online](https://wedge1.hcauditor.org/)
      and linked to the parcel identifers in the `cagis_parcels` tabular data resource.\n\nCreate...\n\nstored...\n\nread....\n\n##
      Estimating the number of households per parcel\n\nCertain calculations needs
      to be weighted by households instead of\nparcel; e.g. “What fraction of families
      live near roadway in Avondale?”.\nWe assume the following as a conservative
      estimate of the number of\nhouseholds per parcel for each `land_use` code:\n\n|
      `land_use`                      | n households |\n|:--------------------------------|-------------:|\n|
      single family dwelling          |            1 |\n| condominium unit                |
