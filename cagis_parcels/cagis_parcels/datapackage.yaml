      # CAGIS Parcels Data

      The `cagis_parcels` tabular-data-resource contains parcel identifiers, parcel addresses, and parcel characteristics downloaded from the [Cincinnati Area Geographic Information System (CAGIS)](https://cagismaps.hamilton-co.org/cagisportal/mapdata/download).

      Auditor parcel-level data were excluded if they (1) did not contain a parcel identifier, (2) did not contain a property address number/name, or (3) had a duplicated parcel identifier.

      Parcels with the following land use categories are included in the data resource and others are excluded.
      These were selected to reflect *residential* usages of parcels.

      | land_use                       |
      |:------------------------------:|
      | single family dwelling         |
      | condominium unit               |
      | two family dwelling            |
      | apartment, 4-19 units          |
      | landominium                    |
      | three family dwelling          |
      | condo or pud garage            |
      | other residential structure    |
      | metropolitan housing authority |
      | apartment, 40+ units           |
      | apartment, 20-39 units         |
      | manufactured home              |
      | office / apartment over        |
      | boataminium                    |
      | other commercial housing       |
      | mobile home / trailer park     |
      | lihtc res                      |

      Some of the parcel characteristics do not make sense in certain contexts and should not be interpreted incorrectly; for example, the value of a parcel for a multi-family or multi-unit housing structure shouldnâ€™t be compared to the value of a parcel for a single-family household for the purposes of assesing individual-level SES.
