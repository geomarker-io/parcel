The goal of parcel is to provide tools for matching real-world addresses to reference sets of addresses. 

Address matching is completed by calculating the "hashdress", in which an address is cleaned, parsed into components, combined into a "parsed_address", and 'expanded' into all possible addresses based on abbreviations. (See the [DeGAUSS](https://degauss.org) [postal](https://github.com/degauss-org/postal#geomarker-methods) container for details.) The cleaned, parsed, and expanded addresses are then each hashed to create a unique set of hashdress identifers for a specific address, termed "hashdresses":

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph clean/parse
    addr(address) --> paddr(parsed address)
    end	
    subgraph expand
    paddr --> expanded_address_1 & expanded_address_2 & expanded_address_3
    end	
    expanded_address_1 --> hashed_address_1	
    expanded_address_2 --> hashed_address_2	
    expanded_address_3 --> hashed_address_3	
    subgraph hash
    hashed_address_1
    hashed_address_2
    hashed_address_3
    end	
    hashed_address_1 & hashed_address_2 & hashed_address_3 --> hddr(hashdresses)
    subgraph combine
    hddr
    end	
```

This allows the matching of an address like "352 Helen Street" to "352 Helen St." or "352 helen st". This type of address matching can be used to match addresses in collected data to a set of addresses with parcel identifiers obtained from a county auditor, or other open/commercial datasets describing the conditions specific to a parcel of land.

With this specific goal in mind, parcel includes:

- **`hashdress()`**: a function to clean, normalize, expand, and hash addresses 
- **`cagis_hashdresses`**: a reference address-parcel set of hashdresses for Hamilton County, OH (including parcel-specific county auditor tax data)
- **`add_parcel_id()`**: a function to directly add parcel identifers to addresses in Hamilton County, OH based on the parsed street number and street name 

## Installation

You can install the development version of parcel like so:

``` r
renv::install("geomarker-io/parcel")
```

## Example

``` r
library(parcel)

data.frame(address = c(
  "3937 Rose Hill Ave Cincinnati OH 45229",
  "424 Klotter Ave Cincinnati OH 45214",
  "3328 Bauerwoods Dr Cincinnati OH 45251"
)) |>
  add_parcel_id() |>
  tidyr::unnest(cols = c(parcel_id))
